# valleyfair-app
Project 12-2

This app handles a ticket queue. It initally loads into a settings/options screen that sets the limit to the number of people allowed on the ride
It makes use of a timer to check and see when riders may board by automatically updating the ticket list. 

Program is still in development , has a few bugs still.
